<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Catalog Description</h4>
<p>Studio art class exploring the relationship between sound and image in diverse fields of practice such as film, video art, music
videos, live performances, installations, and video games.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Course Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>This course is an introduction and integration of sound and sonic compositions to advance multidisciplinary visual practices,
design, communication, and art. Throughout the semester we will examine the language, context, and practice of sound
production and how artists have contributed to and utilized this in their works. We will explore, compare, and contrast
industry-standard/normative approaches with radical/experimental takes of various media in realtion to sound. Our aim is to
establish a rich understanding of the complex and evolving environment in which artists and designers have been
exploring the intimate realtions of sound and images. Students will explore technical, critical, and creative tools to
realize audiovisual projects and to gain a deeper understanding of sound and media as a form of expression and
communication.
</p> 
<p>In a series of weekly exercises, projects, presentations, discussions, workshops, and screenings students will explore and study
the following:
</p> 
     
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">Principles and physics of sound: timing, composition, pitch, amplitude, timbre, etc
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Sound recording, editing, layering, and processing
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Everyday sounds as compositional materials
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Sound in multidisciplinary practices: visual art, cinema, performance, games, music, sculpture
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Dynamic relations between sound and image
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Effective use of audio in evoking and directing emotions
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Sonic experiences through architecture, installation, and immersive media</li></ul>
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Health and Safety Requirements</h4>
<p>All students, faculty and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all <a 
href="https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank" >university safety and
health guidance</a>, which includes wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical
distance at all times. Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for repeated
offenses.
</p> 
<p>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Format &#x0026; Delivery</h4>
<p>This is a hands-on, process-oriented studio. It is comprised of presentations, assignments, participatory activities and
exercises, individual and group discussions, and reviews. This course is <span class="texthl"><span id="textcolor1">hybrid or in-person</span></span>. Synchronous Zoom meetings
will be used for the introduction of assignments, some demonstrations, breakout group meetings, and group
critique discussions. Other activities such as working on assignments and exercises, viewing videos, and reading
assignments will be executed synchronously and asynchronously. In-person activities will include demonstrations,
presentations, group exercises, and critiques. Weekly announcements will serve to inform when activities will take
place.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That means that up to three-fourths of
your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course
during the scheduled two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
otherwise.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Attendance</h4>
<p>Each unexcused absence (beyong the allowed three) will result in one full letter grade deduction (e.g. B+ to C+). Six
unexcused absences (20% of the semester) results in a failed grade. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, contact
us beforehand. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If
you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. Any disputes
should be discussed within two weeks.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
The Department of Art acknowledges that illness, family obligations, and other conflicts with your classes do occur from time
to time and up to three absences are allowed for any reason during the semester without penalty. <span class="textul">All absences from class will
be counted, however, and in the instance that you miss three class meetings, you are required to meet us to discuss strategies
for avoiding additional absences</span>.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
It has been determined that some in-person learning is necessary for you to successfully engage your instructor and peers,
course activities, and to meet learning objectives. Timely and consistent contributions are critical in all formats used to
deliver the content of this course. In the instance of class-wide quarantine or campus closure, a course contingency plan has
been designed so that we can transition to an exclusively on-line format if we are required to actuate one. <span class="textul">Attendance will be
taken regardless of delivery format.</span>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Participation</h4>
<p>Attendance, productive class activity and, meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the assessment of your progress. You
are expected to be present and active for the entire class period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do
the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback during
critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and
taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and
identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be
willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us
know.

<p><a 
 id="communication"></a>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-12000"></a>Communication</h4>
<p><a 
href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" >Discord</a> is used as our primary mode of communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a 
href="https://discord.gg/rxRWkr88ZZ" target="_blank" >server</a>, and keep
up to date with announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings, screenings, and
learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a>Discord Server Interaction</h4>
<p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord <a 
href="https://discord.gg/rxRWkr88ZZ" target="_blank" >server</a> is required. We will use Discord to gather and share
resources, respond to readings and peers’ works, and share your work in progress.
</p> 
<p>Throughout the semester, students will submit a variety of posts to our Discord server, among them:
</p> 
     
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">Responses to readings in the form of text, audio, images, sketches, or video.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Exercise submissions as project files, audio files, video links (uploaded to Youtube or Vimeo), rendered stills,
etc.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Project proposals in PDF format or as Word documents.</li></ul>
<p>
</p> 

                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a>Readings, Discussions &#x0026; Presentations</h4>
<p>During the semester, you will be assigned readings on a variety of topics. The readings are intended to familiarize you with
some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field. We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class.
Your participation in these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn
from one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a foundation for
discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of the ideas from the readings in
practice.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-18000"></a>Sample Library</h4>
<p>Throughout the semester, we will collect and contribute a series of field recordings to a sample library shared among your
peers. This library serves as a repository using which you will create, examine, and experiment with long-format audiovisual
production. During the first two weeks, you will each submit five recordings (per week) to our sample library. In addition to
these early ten recordings, you will submit 14 additional recordings — 2 per week assigned on seven weeks. By the end of the
semester, this activity results in 24 recordings submitted by each of you. This should result in a library of roughly 300 sounds
by week 12 of the semester.

<p>Sounds can be recorded on your phone or using other appropriate devices. Your sounds can range anywhere in terms of
length. Pay attention to interesting sounds that can operate as unique aural components: the closing of a book as percussive
sounds, the ignition of a car engine as melody, or the sound of boiling eggs as rhythm; your imagination is the limit! Name
your sound files as <code>[TYPE] Recording RAW/CLEAN (Firstname Lastname)</code>. For example, I might submit a file as <code>[DRUMS]
Boiling Eggs RAW (Hirad Sab)</code>. The <code>[TYPE]</code> is for you to decide based on the most appropriate category. As we learn how to
master and clean our recordings, we will submit our sounds with the <code>CLEAN</code> tag, e.g. <code>[DRUMS] Boiling Eggs <b>CLEAN</b> (Hirad
Sab)</code>

 id="x1-25000"></a>Course Materials and Tools</h4>
<p>Our course heavily relies on free, open-source, and libre software. Throughout the semester, we will explore the aural and
visual realms through a variety of software and techniques. We will primarily use <a 
href="https://www.reaper.fm/" target="_blank" >Reaper</a> as our digital audio workstation
(DAW) as we explore different audio-plugins, virtual modular synthesizers such as <a 
href="https://vcvrack.com/Rack" target="_blank" >VCV Rack</a>, audio analysis tools such as
<a 
href="https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html" target="_blank" >Adobe Audition</a> and <a 
href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank" >Audacity</a>, while also discussing other established and emerging tools aimed at creative and experimental

href="https://sonic-pi.net/" target="_blank" >Sonic Pi</a>, etc.) As this is a high-level special topic
course, and given the department’s heavily visual-oriented curriculum, we assume that you are already well-versed in visual
thinking and the production of moving images. Thus students are allowed to freely choose their software, techniques, and
medium of visual production. Nevertheless, in our demonstrations, we will explore how sound can build upon, augment,
complement, and complicate visual artifacts. To achieve this, we will use different digital content creation (DCC) suites
such as <a 
href="http://blender.org/" target="_blank" >Blender</a>, <a 
href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/" target="_blank" >DaVinci Resolve</a>, and <a 
href="https://derivative.ca/" target="_blank" >TouchDesigner</a> to demonstrate concepts as they relate to sound and
image.

href="https://discord.gg/rxRWkr88ZZ" target="_blank" >server</a>, and keep
up to date with announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings, screenings, and
learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.

<p>You are required to signup for <a

</p> 
<p>All required readings and screenings will be posted on our Discord <a

coordinate and discuss with the department the possibilitites of lab computer use. However, given our current post-COVID
reality, this course is structured such that projects and exercises can be completed with consumer-grade PCs and
laptops.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-26000"></a>Project</h3>
<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-27000"></a>Note:</span>
In light of the pandemic and its imposed limitations regarding space, fabrication, and occupying space, the project has
been designed to permit engagement with the concepts and tools of this course without compromising your
physical and mental health, your peers’, families’, and faculties’. To this end, those interested can use their
preferred visual software and medium, as well as other familiar avenues to explore and engage with this class
from the visual aspect. Do note that all of our activities, readings, assignments, and the course in general,
are structured so that your efforts throughout the semester build towards your first and final phases of your
project.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-28000"></a>Description</h4>
<p>Throughout the semester, you will work towards realizing one semester-long project. The work associated with this
undertaking is divided into two phases. The first phase of this project is tentatively designated as <span class="textul"><b>prototype</b></span> and is due by
the semester’s 8th week. The second and <span class="textul"><b>final</b></span> phase is aimed at <em>maturing, enhancing, and extending</em> your pieces while
crafting fine details and adding intricacies to your work.
</p> 
     
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize"> <b>Project: Prototype Submission</b> <span class="texthl"><span id="textcolor2"><b>(Due Week 8)</b></span></span>
</li>     
<li class="itemize"> <b>Project: Final Submission</b> <span class="texthl"><span id="textcolor3"><b>(Due Week 15)</b></span></span>  </li></ul>
<p><a 
 id="projformat"></a>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-29000"></a>Medium &#x0026; Format</h4>
<p>The primary limiting factor in creating your semester-long project requires that your piece falls under the <b>“moving image”</b>
umbrella term. While this prevents you from engaging with certain mediums, it allows you to imagine your project in any of
the following formats:
</p> 
     
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">Film
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Video art
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     
</li>
<li class="itemize">Music videos
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Videogames
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Interactive media
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Generative media
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Web-based experiences
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Audiovisual performances
</li>     
<li class="itemize">System-based and simulation media
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Other screen-based/projected/interactive media</li></ul>
<p>Work that subverts or transgresses the aforementioned categories should be explained and appropriately communicated in
project proposals. Depending on your medium of choice, your projects must be accessible to the rest of the class. This requires
that <span class="textul">interactive material such as games and web-based media must be distributed in formats that allow your peers and cohort
to experience them as intended</span>. In addition, interactive media must be accompanied by video documentation during
submissions.
</p> 
<p><a 
 id="projduration"></a>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30000"></a>Duration &#x0026; Repetition</h4>
<p>The length of your projects can vary depending on your concept, execution, and medium; however, there is a <span class="textul"><b>hard limit of 2
minutes minimum</b></span>. You are free to extend your projects’ length, especially if you plan to work with durational forms of
moving images such as film and video art. However, note that you are encouraged to complicate and break the temporal
cliches by creating <span class="textul"><b>looping, indefinite, and generative</b></span> media.
</p> 
<p><a 
 id="projstyle"></a>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-31000"></a>Sound &#x0026; Image</h4>
<p>It goes without noting, but the realization and assessment of this project are intrinsically linked to how sound and moving
images operate in your project. Use sound to <em>complicate, complement, and contemplate</em> your moving images. Your
composition of sound and visuals must be <em>coherent, intentional, and appropriate</em> so that it can <em>clearly communicate your
concept, ideas, and intentions</em>. Your sounds and images must <em>exert control</em> over each other and your audience. In many ways,
they can <em>accentuate, emphasize, and desensitize</em> the other half. Each half can <em>mask, enhance, and direct</em> the other. Moreover,
they can <em>limit or extend the boundaries</em> of the imagination and depicted realities as they collaborate to <em>evoke,
provoke, interact and entertain</em> your audiences. <b><em>Think of this project as a tango of sound and moving
images</em></b>.

<p>What do these phenomena look like? What do they sound like? How can we render them experiential? Now take all of these
thoughts and reimagine them with your own voice, touch, and expression in a medium that you are comfortable with and
excited to explore. A short documentary, an experimental video, or a looping narrative? Fantastic! Interactive media,
videogames, web-based art, or live audiovisual performance? Exciting! Soul-soothing and soul-sucking, tender and violent?

project’s requirements. You can choose to realize your project in a draft and final phase, whereby you use the first half of the
semester to submit a completed-yet-rough version of your project and use the second half of the semester to add detail and
bring it to maturity. Alternatively, you can divide the execution process into two. For example, suppose you are working on a
short film or documentary. In that case, you can choose to shoot, edit and compose all your footage during the first
half of the semester while working on sound, visual effects, and final touches during the second half of the
semester. Regardless of the path you take, be it <em>repeated-drafting</em> of your project from start to finish, or to
<em>divide-and-conquer</em> major aspects of it, each phase requires that you <span class="textul"><b>submit completed and substantial
work</b></span> such that it represents half of the effort you deem necessary in perfecting your concepts, ideas, and
pieces.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-34000"></a>Assessment</h4>
<p>You are to demonstrate a creative and critical engagement with the course material: techniques, theory, and concepts, as
demonstrated and discussed in workshops, readings, presentations, and screenings. Your mastery and articulation, your
creative, innovative, and imaginative approach, as well as your personal voice and touch, in addition to the elegance and
eloquence of your projects, are deciding factors in the assessment of your pieces.

Your first challenge is to familiarize yourself with some of the fundamentals, practices, techniques, and 
skills that relate to audio. For this challenge, you are to engage with the <a 
href="http://www.acousticslab.org/RECA220/" target="_blank" >Fundamentals of Sound</a> course 
by Prof. Vassilakis. Try to tackle as many of the topics as you can. The organized format 
of the website allows for both surface-level and in-depth examination of the topics. Use 
these as entry points to understand the physical and emotional properties of sound and how 
to experiment with them. After you are done engaging with the fundamentals, choose 4 
of the topics or aspects of sound (pitch, amplitude, timbre, frequency, etc.) and write a 
5-6 sentence summary for each concept. Submit your writings to our Discord server under

Select a footage of minimum 1:30-minute length. This can be a scene/shot from one of you favorite 
movies — or perhaps one that you despise — a music video, segment from the news, etc. For 
this exercise you are to remove the audio from this footage and replace it with one that 
you reimagine (using our class sound library or any of the resources from week 2). We are 
most interested in work that through reconstruction of audio, dramatically changes the 
original mood of the video. Upload you videos to Youtube or Vimeo and submit the link to

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-44000"></a>PPE and Related College Covid Policies</h4>
<p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, health symptom
monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at
<a 
href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank" >safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff are expected to meet the behavioral and safety
expectations under the Safe Campus Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on
or off campus. All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to report
body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus. Failure to adhere to these
requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation,
whereby adherence will be reinforced through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary
action whenever possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
follows:
</p> 
     
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the student and/or student
organization’s behavior endangers the health or safety of campus community members, on or off campus, and/or
fails to comply with the directives outlined in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which
a student is not adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this does
not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy requirements. If the student
continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave the location and not to return until they are prepared
to follow the requirements.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident should be reported
to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate
tracking. Even if the student’s name is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the
university in evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct will be
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     
unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-45000"></a>COVID-19-Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h4>
<p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required quarantine due to exposure will
transition course activities to distance learning to the extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students
will work with instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities related to course objectives
and assignments will be provided.
</p> 
<p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online interactions and learning at a distance will
occur. All university standards and policies remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for
students with disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be meeting and interacting
in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves and treat others as if we are meeting in
person.
</p> 
<p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online delivery mode for the remainder of the
semester.
</p> 
<p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms, or required
quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may
transition to an online delivery mode temporarily.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-46000"></a>Academic Misconduct</h4>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation
of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic
misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection
with examinations and artwork created in studio courses. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic
misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the <a 
href="https://studentconduct.osu.edu/for-students/understanding-the-student-conduct-process/" target="_blank" >Code of Student
Conduct</a>
</p> 
<p>The Department of Art adheres to all aspects of this Code of Conduct especially in matters relating to the following:
Academic Misconduct, Endangering Health or Safety, Sexual Misconduct, Destruction of Property, and Theft/Unauthorized
Use of Property.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-47000"></a>Reusing Past Work</h4>
<p>In general, you are prohibited in university courses from turning in work from a past class to your current class, even if you
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
modify it. If you want to build on past research or revisit a topic explored in previous courses, please discuss the situation
with your instructor at the start of the assignment/project.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-48000"></a>Citing Your Sources</h4>
<p>Cite your sources to back up what you say and write. (Use a citation generator if you are unsure of the proper citation
format.) If you use a photograph or are particularly inspired by another work and wish to include, mimic, or apply any part
of it to your work, cite it. We will discuss precedent usage and appropriation in class. While precedent usage is expected to
inspire new iterations and build skills, you are expected to credit your sources and work to distinct and individual challenge
solutions.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-49000"></a>Disability Services</h4>
<p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic
barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let us know
immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, we may request that you
register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with us as soon as possible to discuss
your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Fore more information contact the SLDS
office.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-50000"></a>Accommodations</h4>
<p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to make <em>reasonable accommodations</em> for
students who are unable to be safely present in the classroom <em>and</em> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of
Student Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean streaming lectures on
Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that involve laboratory work, studio work,
or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable accommodation will not always be possible. Students are
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
expected to work with their advisors and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling
needs.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-51000"></a>Grade Forgiveness</h4>
<p>The Grade Forgiveness Rule allows undergraduate students to petition to repeat up to three courses. The grade in the
repeated course will permanently replace the original grade for the course in the calculation of the student’s cumulative
GPA.
</p> 
<p>Only a first repeat can be used this way; all other repeats of the same course will be included under the general course
repeatability rule.
</p> 
<p>The original grade will remain on the student’s transcript and some graduate/professional school admission
processes will re-calculate the student’s GPA to include the original grade. See: <a 
href="https://advising.osu.edu/grade-forgiveness-0" target="_blank" >Grade Forgiveness</a> for more
information.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-52000"></a>Diversity</h4>
<p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body. Our programs and curricula
reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to provide opportunities for students to learn more about
persons who are different from them. We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and
values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect
among each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach <span class="sout">his or her</span> their own
potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status, which is defined as age, color,
disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is
prohibited.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-53000"></a>Sexual Misconduct/Relationship Violence</h4>
<p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same
kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories (e.g.,
race). If you or someone you know has been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate
resources at <a 
href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank" >http://titleix.osu.edu</a> or by contacting the Ohio State Title IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at
<a 
href="mailto:titleix@osu.edu" target="_blank" >titleix@osu.edu</a>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-54000"></a>Mental Health Services</h4>
<p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships,
increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These
mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s
ability to participate in daily activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing
these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the
aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services
available on campus via the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS) by visiting
<a 
href="http://ccs.osu.edu/" target="_blank" >ccs.osu.edu</a> or calling <a 
href="tel:614\-2925766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a>. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center and 10th
Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call counselor when CCS is closed at <a 
href="tel:614\-292-5766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a> and 24 hour

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-55000"></a>Trigger Language Warning</h4>
<p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to descriptions of and/or scenes
depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while
watching/reading this material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend, contacting a
Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a 
href="tel:6142921111" target="_blank" >614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a 
href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a>, and
contacting the instructor if needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming this
media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to each other may result in dismissal from
the class.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-56000"></a>General Class and Studio Policies</h4>
<p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of
race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
to the instructor and may include the student’s legal name unless changed via the University Name Change policy. We will
gladly honor your request to address you by another name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so
that we may make appropriate changes to our records.

<p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language, imagery, or dialogue that may
be challenging or offend some students. While no student is required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or
design that offends them, it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful manner. Art
can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively discussion, concepts and imagery.
Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.) can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and
provocative, so please, engage in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as

<p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances develop during the term) if
you have circumstances that may affect your performance and ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this
