    \begin{itemize}
              \item Signup sheets are posted to Discord for Tuesday and Thursday. Feedback and hands-on problem-solving sessions will be provided during the entire class. Students are free to join either in person or virtually through Zoom. When you are signing up, select \textbf{ONE} of the available two days so that we can accommodate the campus safe and health policies.  Have your projects ready on an external disk to be brought to class.
